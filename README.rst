This repository contains a [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) package for the [Multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).
The package can be easily installed with [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/).

Please consult the following RFCs for additional information about the Multicast DNS protocol:
- DNS: [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)
- Multicast DNS: [RFC 6762](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762)


Prerequisites
-------------

Before trying to install the package, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)
- [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) command `zkg`
- [Spicy plugin](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/spicy/en/latest/index.html) for Zeek

Everything should be installed correctly if you install the latest [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) version.


Installation
----------

To run unit tests and install the package, run:

```shell
zkg install https://github.com/zeek-plugins/mdns  # to install as super user
zkg --user install https://github.com/zeek-plugins/mdns  # to install in user space
```

You might have to update the `ZEEKPATH` and `ZEEK_PLUGIN_PATH` environmental variables.
To see which value they should take, run the following commands:
```shell
zkg env         # For the super user
zkg --user env  # For a normal user
```

To confirm that installation was successful, you can run the following command:
```shell
zeek -NN | grep mDNS
```

If the command's output shows something similar to:
```
IoT::mDNS - Multicast DNS (mDNS) package for Zeek (dynamic, version 1.0.0)
```
the package was correctly installed, and you have access to the mDNS package.

In the case of any installation problems, please check the [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) documentation.
