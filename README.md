# Multicast DNS (mDNS) package for Zeek IDS


This repository contains a [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) script-only package for the [Multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS).
It defines new mDNS events and enables mDNS logging, both based on the built-in DNS events and logging capabilities.
The package can be easily installed with [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/).

Please consult the following RFCs for additional information about the Multicast DNS protocol:
- DNS: [RFC 1035](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1035)
- Multicast DNS: [RFC 6762](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762)


## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before trying to install the package, make sure you have the following tools installed:

- [Zeek](https://zeek.org/)
- [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) command `zkg`

Everything should be installed correctly if you install the latest [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) version.


### Setup

To run unit tests and install the package, run:
```shell
zkg install https://github.com/zeek-plugins/mdns  # to install as super user
zkg --user install https://github.com/zeek-plugins/mdns  # to install in user space
```

You might have to update the `ZEEKPATH` environmental variable
to have access to packages installed with `zkg`.
To see which value it should take, run the following commands:
```shell
zkg env         # For the super user
zkg --user env  # For a normal user
```

In the case of any installation problems, please check the [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/) documentation.


## Usage

In order to use the mDNS events and activate mDNS logging,
you must explicitly load the package inside your Zeek scripts,
with the following directive:
```zeek
@load path/to/mdns/scripts
```
If you correctly updated the aforementioned `ZEEKPATH` variable,
the scripts path should only be `mdns`.

### Events

The plugin defines the following events:

- `event mdns_message(c: connection, is_orig: bool, msg: dns_msg, len: count)`
  - Generated for any mDNS message.
- ``event mdns_request(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, query: string, qtype: count, qclass: count, original_query: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS requests.
- ``event mdns_rejected(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, query: string, qtype: count, qclass: count, original_query: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies that reject a query.
- ``event mdns_query_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, query: string, qtype: count, qclass: count, original_query: string)``
  - Generated for each entry in the Question section of a mDNS reply.
- ``event mdns_A_reply (c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, a: addr)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *A*.
- ``event mdns_AAAA_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, a: addr)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *AAAA*.
- ``event mdns_A6_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, a: addr)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *A6*.
- ``event mdns_NS_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, name: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *NS*.
- ``event mdns_CNAME_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, name: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *CNAME*.
- ``event mdns_PTR_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, name: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *PTR*.
- ``event mdns_SOA_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, soa: dns_soa)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *CNAME*
- ``event mdns_WKS_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *WKS*.
- ``event mdns_HINFO_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, cpu: string, os: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *HINFO*.
- ``event mdns_MX_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, name: string, preference: count)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *MX*.
- ``event mdns_TXT_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, strs: string_vec)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *TXT*.
- ``event mdns_SPF_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, strs: string_vec)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *SPF*.
- ``event mdns_CAA_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, flags: count, tag: string, value: string)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *CAA* (Certification Authority Authorization).
- ``event mdns_SRV_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer, target: string, priority: count, weight: count, p: count)``
  - Generated for mDNS replies of type *SRV*.
- ``event mdns_unknown_reply(c: connection, msg: dns_msg, ans: dns_answer)``
  - Generated for mDNS reply resource records when the type of record is not one that Zeek knows how to parse and generate another more specific event.
- ``event mdns_end(c: connection, msg: dns_msg)``
  - Generated at the end of processing a mDNS packet. This event is the last ``mdns_*`` event that will be raised for a mDNS query/reply and signals that all resource records have been passed on.

For more information about the events, please consult Zeek's documentation about [DNS events](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/scripts/base/bif/plugins/Zeek_DNS.events.bif.zeek.html), which are the unicast equivalent of this plugin's mDNS events.


### Logging

The plugin can automatically log all the mDNS traffic that it sees, in the same way as the Zeek DNS plugin.
This produces the `mdns.log` file, which contains, for each mDNS message seen, the following information:

* `ts`: The earliest time at which a DNS protocol message over the associated connection is observed.
* `uuid`: A unique identifier of the connection over which mDNS messages are being transferred.
* `id`: The connection's 4-tuple of endpoint addresses/ports.

   * `id.orig_h`: The originator's IP address.
   * `id.orig_p`: The originator's port.
   * `id.resp_h`: The responder's IP address.
   * `id.resp_p`: The responder's port.

* `proto`: The transport layer protocol of the connection (always UDP).
* `trans_id`: A 16-bit identifier assigned by the program that generated the DNS query.  Also used in responses to match up replies to outstanding queries.
* `rtt` Round trip time for the query and response. This indicates the delay between when the request was seen until the answer started.
* `query`: The domain name that is the subject of the DNS query.
* `qclass`: The QCLASS value specifying the class of the query.
* `qclass_name`: A descriptive name for the class of the query.
* `qtype`: The QTYPE value specifying the type of the query.
* `qtype_name`: A descriptive name for the type of the query.
* `rcode`: The response code value in DNS response messages.
* `rcode_name`: A descriptive name for the response code value.
* `AA`: The Authoritative Answer bit for response messages specifies that the responding name server is an authority for the domain name in the question section.
* `TC`: The Truncation bit specifies that the message was truncated.
* `RD`: The Recursion Desired bit in a request message indicates that the client wants recursive service for this query.
* `RA`: The Recursion Available bit in a response message indicates that the name server supports recursive queries.
* `Z`: A reserved field that is usually zero in queries and responses.
* `answers`: The set of resource descriptions in the query answer.
* `TTLs`: The caching intervals of the associated RRs described by the *answers* field.
* `rejected`: The DNS query was rejected by the server.
